# Introduction

Lyfebloc Network is a highly scalable modular blockchain powering dynamic applications with extensive full-stack adaptability that securely scales with the number of users, making it easy for anyone to launch their own blockchain.

Lyfebloc enables the next generation of scalable blockchain architectures to bootstrap new blockchain networks while providing full compatibility with Ethereum smart contracts and transactions

Lyfebloc Network operates without restrictions, empowering the community to run nodes that boost Transactions Per Second (TPS) and allowing participation from individuals no matter where they are or what their backgrounds entail.

Lyfebloc Network uses IBFT (Istanbul Byzantine Fault Tolerant) consensus mechanism while supporting communication with multiple blockchain networks, enabling transfers of both ERC-20 and ERC-721 tokens, by utilising our own decentralized bridge solution.

Industry standard wallets can be used to interact with Lyfebloc Network through the JSON-RPC endpoints and node operators can perform various actions on the nodes through the gRPC protocol.
